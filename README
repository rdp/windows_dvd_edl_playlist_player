NB:

Project must be re-located to be exactly in this subdirectory, to build:
(your equivalent of:)

D:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Samples\multimedia\directshow\dvd 

(you have to download and install the microsoft SDK first, of course).

Basically this project is a "working live demo" of using the "dvd navigator"
IDvdGraphBuilder  and idvdcontrol etc. and friends to demonstrate using them, in windows, to control a DVD playback graph so that 
playback is "edited" like an EDL
